Step 1 Wash the mutton and marinate
Wash the mutton pieces (chopped into cubes) in running water. Keep aside to drain. When the water has almost dried, add the marinade ingredients. Mix well using your hands, rubbing the spices into the meat. Marinate for 1-2 hours.

Step 2 Cook the masala
Now take a heavy-bottomed pan and heat. One with a tight lid is preferred. Add oil and ghee. When smoke starts coming out of it, add the whole spices. Add a pinch of sugar. It gives an amazing colour to the mutton.

Step 3 Saute the onions
Add the chopped onions and cook on low flame for 10 minutes. At this point, you can add the salt. This increases the cooking process of onion. When the onions turn translucent, reduce the heat and wait for them to turn pink. Add turmeric and mix well. You can add turmeric at a later stage also, but adding it in the beginning of the recipe helps you get rid of that raw smell of the spice.

Step 4 Add the marinated meat and cook
Now add the marinated mutton, ginger garlic paste and cook on high flame for 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously.

Step 5 Cover the lid and cook
Cover the lid of the vessel, lower the flame and allow it to simmer. When the mutton is almost done, add coriander, cumin, black pepper and mix well.

Step 6 Garnish and serve hot!
Cook uncovered till oil starts separating from the meat. Add a cup of water, garam masala powder and cook uncovered till oil floats on top. Transfer the mutton curry into a bowl, adjust seasoning, garnish with ginger juliennes, coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or chapatti.
